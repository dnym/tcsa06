# Drinks Info
An implementation of [the sixth project of The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/15).

## Project Description
The project is a console based drinks lookup application for a hypothetical restaurant client. Data is read from TheCocktailDB, a public API for information on alcoholic drinks.

### Requirements
- Data is read from the restaurant's database (simulated by using TheCocktailDB) which is out of the application's control.
- The application is for employees to get information on any drink in the database.
- The data is presented in a user-friendly way.
- The first screen shows a "Drinks Category Menu" where the user chooses a category.
- The user can choose a drink to view information about it.
- When showing drink details, there is no empty-valued property.
